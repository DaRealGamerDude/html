     <h1>Hi, I am Bhavit!</h1>
        
     <hr>

     <p>I'm an ambitious and curious B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science and Technology, with a strong passion for artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and modern web development. I bring a hands-on mindset to my learning, currently building projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while actively exploring AI-driven applications in both fintech and security domains. With a solid foundation in technology and a deep personal interest in motorsports, I balance technical expertise with creativity and a competitive spirit. I'm constantly driven to improve, whether through coding, researching cutting-edge tools, or collaborating with others to turn ideas into impactful solutions.</p>

     <p>When I’m not deep into code or tech stuff, I’m usually geeking out over motorsports- F1, MotoGP, WEC, WRC, and the absolute madness that is the Isle of Man TT. I’ve also got a thing for finance, gaming, music, aviation and anything that involves rockets and space exploration. Honestly, I just love learning cool stuff and talking to people who are into the same weird mix of things. Some of the best ideas (and laughs) come from late night chats with like minded folks online and that’s just as much a part of who I am as the technical side.</p>
